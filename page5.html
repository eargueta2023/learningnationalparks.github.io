     <h1>Great Smoky Mountains National Park</h1>

        <h2>Park's History & Significance</h2>
        <p>Established in 1934 by Congress, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is known for its biodiversity, mountains, and preserved Appalachian culture and holds the distinction of being the most visited national park in the United States. It is located in Southeastern United States, with parts in both North Carolina and Tennessee. For thousands of years, this region provided home for numerous successive cultures of Indegenous peoples, indluding the Cherokee. 
            European Americans began settling here in the late 18th century and President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act that cleared this area of its native tribes. Logging became an enormous industry in this are and was stripping the region of its trees, until the park became protected in the 1930's.</p>
