       <h1> Yosemite National Park</h1>
       <h2>Park's History & Significance</h2>
       <p> Yosemite was established as a National Park on October 1, 1890 by Congress. Before this, Native Americans were the main residents of the Yosemite Valley. This was up until the Gold Rush in 1849, which brough many non-Indegenous miners, settlers, and tourists into the region.
        Along with them damage to the ecosystem followed, pushing conservationalists to fight for the establishment of protected park systems. It holds historical significance as it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was a prominent focal point for the conservational movement, leading to the establishment of the National Park System.</p>
